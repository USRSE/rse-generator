Welcome to the RSEng Phenotype Generator!

## What kind of Research Software Engineer are you?

### What is an RSE?
On the <a href="https://us-rse.org/" target="_blank">us-rse.org</a> we describe an inclusive definition of
what it means to be a research software engineer, or RSE. It generally means you use practices
from software development to advance research. But what if you also do a lot of open source development?
Or research on your own? What if you serve multiple communities?

### Why the RSE Phenotype Generator?</h2>
It wouldn't be right to say that an RSE must fall within a strict set of categories, or dimensions. Nor
would it be correct to assume that all RSEs serve the same user communities. This is the reason that
this tool exists - with the RSE Phenotype generator <strong>you</strong> are the one that gets
to decide the dimensions that are relevant to you (open source and research? high performance computing and software
engineering? Documentation and testing? Something else?) along with the communities that you serve, for which you
could provide a score for each dimension.

### How do I participate?
